            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.</p>
            <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</p>
            <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
            <p>Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
            <code>
                def greet(name):
                    return "Hello, " + name
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC language.</li>
                <li>Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting.</li>
                <li>Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.</li>
                <li>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</li>
                <li>Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability, and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.</p>
            <p>A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source reference implementation.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
    <header>Data Types</header>
    <p>Python has several built-in data types.</p>
    <p>Some of these are numeric types such as int, float, and complex.</p>
    <code>my_int = 10</code>
    <code>my_float = 20.5</code>
    <code>my_complex = 1j</code>
    <p>Python also has sequence types like list, tuple, and range.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.</li>
        <li>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.</li>
        <li>The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow">
    <header>Control Flow</header>
    <p>Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <code>if a > b:</code>
    <code>print("a is greater than b")</code>
    <code>...</code>
    <ul>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...</p>
    <code>...</code>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Functions">
    <header>Functions</header>
    <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <code>def my_function():</code>
    <code>print("Hello from a function")</code>
    <ul>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <code>...</code>
    <code>...</code>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Classes_and_Objects">
    <header>Classes and Objects</header>
    <p>Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stress on objects.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <code>class MyClass:</code>
    <code>x = 5</code>
    <ul>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>...</li>
